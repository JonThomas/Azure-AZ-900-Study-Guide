# Describe factors that can affect costs in Azure

* Resource type
   * Type of resource, the settings for the resource, and the region affect price.
   * Storage account example: type (such as blob), performance tier, access tier, redundancy settings and region affect the price.
   * VM example: operating system, other software, processor, number of cores, attached storage, and network interface affect the price.
* Consumption
   * The more compute used, the more you pay.
   * Can commit to use and pay for a certain amount of resources, typically for 1 or 3 years.
      * Supported by databases, compute and storage.
* Maintenance
   * Turning off resources will reduce price
* Geography
   * Resources are billed differently in different Azure regions.
   * Network traffic is more expensive across continents, than within continents.
   * Inbound traffic might cost money.
   * Outbound traffic is billed by Billing zones. A Billing zone is a geographical grouping of Azure regions for billing purposes. 
* Subscription type
   * Free trial subsciption is free!
* Azure Marketplace
   * Azure based solutions might be bought through the Azure Marketplace. These solutions might cost extra.
