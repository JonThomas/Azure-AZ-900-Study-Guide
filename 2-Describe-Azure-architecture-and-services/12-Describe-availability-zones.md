# Describe availability zones

(see also [Describe Azure regions, region pairs, and sovereign regions](11-Describe-Azure-regions-region-pairs-and-sovereign-regions.md))

## Availability zone
Physically separate datacenters within a region, containing at least one Azure datacenter with independent physical infrastructure (power, cooling, networking etc). 
The availability of one Availability zone shall not affect other Availability zones.
Not all regions support Availability zones.

Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers and SQL databases.
