# Describe Microsoft Entra Conditional Access

* Policies can be implemented to allow or block access to resources using different "signals". Signal examples:
  * Who the user is
  * Where the user is
  * What device the user is requesting access from
* Example policies:
  * Require MFA for administrators
  * Limit which email applications are able to connect to your email service
  * Require users to access your application only from managed devices.
  * Block access from untrusted sources, such as access from unknown or unexpected locations.
