# Describe the purpose of Azure Policy

* Use Azure Policy to ensure that resources in Azure stay compliant, and to be alerted if a resources configuration changes
* Can Control or Audit resources
* A group of related policies is called an Initiative, and can help track your compliance state for a larger goal.
* A policy can be set on any level (Resource, Resource Group, Subscription etc)
* In some cases, Azure Policy can automatically remediate noncompliant resources and configurations
   * For example: Apply a tag to a set of resources
   * Resources flagged as Exceptions will not be automatically remediated
